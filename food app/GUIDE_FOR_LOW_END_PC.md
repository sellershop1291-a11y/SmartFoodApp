# How to Run Your App (No Android Studio Required)

Since you have a low-end PC, you cannot run Android Studio. Instead, we will use **GitHub** (a free cloud website) to build the app for you.

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Account
1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com/signup) and create a free account.
2. Verify your email.

## Step 2: Create a Repository
1. Click the **+** icon in the top right corner and select **New repository**.
2. Name it `SmartFoodApp`.
3. Make it **Public**.
4. Click **Create repository**.

## Step 3: Upload Your Code
1. On the next screen, look for the link that says **"uploading an existing file"**.
2. Open your folder: `C:\Users\Prash\Videos\food app` on your computer.
3. Drag and drop ALL files and folders (SmartFood, .github, etc.) into the browser window.
   - *Note: You might need to do this in batches if there are too many files. Ideally, if you can install "GitHub Desktop" tool, it's easier.*
4. Commit changes (Click the green "Commit changes" button).

## Step 4: Wait for the Cloud Build
1. Once files are uploaded, click the **Actions** tab at the top of your repository page.
2. You should see a workflow named "Build Android APK" running (yellow circle).
3. Wait for 2-5 minutes. It will turn green (Success).

## Step 5: Download & Install on Phone
1. Click on the "Build Android APK" run.
2. Scroll down to the **Artifacts** section.
3. Click **smartfood-debug** to download a zip file.
4. Extract the zip file to find `app-debug.apk`.
5. Send this file to your Android phone (via WhatsApp, USB, or Drive).
6. Install it on your phone!

## Alternative: Web Version
If this is too complicated, I can convert this entire project into a **Web App (Website)**.
- **Pros**: Runs directly in your browser, no installation, instant changes.
- **Cons**: Not a "real" mobile app (no APK), but looks exactly like one.

**Let me know if you want the Web Version instead!**
